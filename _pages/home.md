I am a fourth year PhD student in the computer science department at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am co-advised by [Dr. Eric Rozner](http://ericrozner.com/) and [Dr. Eric Keller](https://eric-keller.github.io). I am broadly interested in operating systems, networking, and scalable systems research, and have recently been focusing on resource management and networking for serverless and containerized cloud workloads. I am also working with [Gerd Zellweger](https://gerdzellweger.com) of VMware Research on a distributed operating systems project. I am very generously supported by a [2021 Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/).

I received my BS in Computer Science and BS in Mathematics from George Fox University (Newberg, OR) in May 2015. After graduation, I worked in public industry for four years before returning to academia.
